Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Backup Manager is a command line backup tool for GNU/Linux, designed 
to help you make daily archives of your file system. Written in bash 
and perl, it can make archives in lots of open formats (tar, gzip, 
bzip2, lzma, dar, zip) and provides lots of interesting features 
(such as network exports or CD/DVD automated-burning).

The program is designed to be as easy to use as possible and is 
popular with desktop users and sysadmins. The whole backup process 
is defined in one full-documented configuration file which needs 
no more than 5 minutes to tune for your needs. It just works.

Archives are kept for a given number of days and the upload system 
can use ftp or scp to transfer the generated archives to a list of 
remote hosts. Gettext is used for internationalization.
